There are actually quite some QOL features to add to fully mimic the sound of a base. See below:

# TODO
- [ ] Add notifications for each race
- [ ] Add mining ambience
- [ ] Separate Broodwar and SC2 music and mining sound options
- [ ] Optimization for web (right now, if I leave this page open for too long on my phone it heats up... and I DON'T KNOW WHY YET)
- [ ] Add device action support (`F8`, `F9` on macOS)
